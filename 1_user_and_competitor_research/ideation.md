# Group 3 - Ideation Report

As a group, we gathered and read through the project brief in the first week of the unit. Using the crazy 8's ideation method, we rapidly developed themes and ideas in a short space of time.

* A guide to bars in Manchester.
* A guide to driving as a student.
* A guide to student accommodation in Manchester.

* A guide to managing general finances.
* A guide to having fun in Manchester.
* A guide to living a green life as a student.
* A guide to public transport in Manchester.
