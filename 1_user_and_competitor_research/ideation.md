# Group 3 - Ideation Report

As a group, we gathered and read through the project brief in the first week of the unit. Using the crazy 8's ideation method, we rapidly developed themes and ideas in a short space of time. This led to us having a wide variety of potential projects. Listed below are the examples we came up with during the project ideation stage:

Once these were established, we debated amongst ourselves which project we thought would be most suitable. Our criteria was as follows:

* Which project will we enjoy working on the most?
* Which project will be as inclusive as possible for our target audience?
* Which project will provide information that is not readily available currently to our target audience?
* Which project will provide us with ample opportunity to include all elements required in the unit specification?

Once this criteria has been debated, the topic we chose for our group project was "A Guide to Affordable Fun in Manchester." We chose this as our topic of focus as we believe it meets the requirements of a student based website that has a relevant and inclusive subject. As a group, we agreed that we should choose a project topic that is both interesting to us and easy to work with. With a broad topic of "Affordable Fun in Manchester", we ensure that we will have plenty to write about as the topic is broad and easily researchable.

After the ideation process, the group seemed fairly confident in the decision as we had covered a lot of potential bases and universally agreed on a final project. We liked being able to express any idea that came to us as this ensured we weren't solutionising during the ideation phase.
